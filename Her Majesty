Once opon a time there was a very wise and pretty queen named Erin who spent most of her time worrying about her rival: the witch Cruella.  Her best shot at besting her bitter enemy was at the upcoming Fairy Queen Ball. 
Erin spent a lot of time preparing for the ball: picking the finest dresses and the pretiest shoes for the night.
Her ennemy Cruella has the most deadfull wapon: an old dangerous dragon that spits fire.
Cruella brought her Dragon to the Ball ...
There was a lot of screaming and fear between the guests but they couldn't leave! Cruella enchanted the palace so no one can leave.
Erin has no choice but to fight the dragon while Cruella laughed so hard she choked in her wine. The dragon was no common beast: he was clever and he was assessing her like a praise and an enemi. But she has a big previliege here: The palace was small for the dragon to move freely so she made her first strike and made him angry enough to try to chase her ... 
Cruella was annoyed by this. So she said that she has a riddle for Erin and if she can solve it slaying the dragon would easier.
Erin didn't trust the witch because after all they are ennemies how can she help her. There is a trick here but she needs to solve the riddle and be carrefull in order to save evryone.
Cruella said:
"There are those who seek me a lifetime but never we meet,
 and those who I kiss but trample me beneath ungratfeul feet.
 
 At times I seem to favor the clever and the fair,
 but I bless all those who are brave enough to dare.
 
 For though each of my strikes land a powrful blow,
 when I kill, I do it slow ... "
 
Ein saw fit to seek help with the riddle.
