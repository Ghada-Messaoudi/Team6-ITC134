Once opon a time there was a very wise and pretty queen who spent most of her time worrying about her rival: the witch Cruella.  Her best shot at besting her bitter enemy was at the upcoming Fairy Queen Ball. 
The queen spent a lot of time preparing for the ball: picking the finest dresses and the pretiest shoes for the night.
Her ennemy Cruella has the most deadfull wapon: an old dangerous dragon that spitts fire.
Cruella brought her Dragon to the Ball ...
There was a lot of screaming and fear between the guests but they couldn't leave! Cruella enchanted the palace so no one can leave.
